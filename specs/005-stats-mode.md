# Stats Mode

We have a basic stats command for the CLI, which allows the user to view aggregated stats by day or by week.

We should add a stats mode to the TUI. This mode will be available via the `Tab` key in list mode.

The stats mode will aggregate the data a bit differently than the existing stats command. This new stats output will align more closely with the `daily-projects` export format from [#6](./006-export.md)
