# Research Findings: combine-start-and-stop

## Decision: Use Cobra Command Aliases with CalledAs() Detection
**Rationale**: Cobra supports command aliases natively, and the CalledAs() method allows detecting which alias was used to invoke the command. This enables implementing different behaviors for 'start', 'stop', and 's' within a single command handler, satisfying the requirement to combine commands while maintaining distinct logic.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate commands with shared logic: Rejected because it violates the "single command" requirement and creates maintenance overhead.
- Subcommands under a parent 'track' command: Rejected as it changes the user interface from the existing start/stop pattern.
- Flag-based approach (e.g., --start/--stop): Rejected as it doesn't match the alias requirement and complicates the CLI.

## Decision: Argument Validation Based on Invocation
**Rationale**: For 'start' and 's' with args: require exactly 2 args (project, task). For 'stop' and 's' without args: reject any args. This ensures the specified error behaviors.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flexible arguments: Rejected because it doesn't enforce the strict requirements for 'start' and 'stop'.
- Optional arguments: Rejected as it conflicts with the error-on-missing-args for 'start'.

## Decision: Maintain Existing Data Models
**Rationale**: The feature doesn't introduce new entities or change existing Task/TimeEntry structures, so no modifications needed.

**Alternatives Considered**: None - no data changes required.

## Decision: Testing Approach
**Rationale**: Use existing Go testing patterns with _test.go files. Create unit tests for command logic and integration tests for CLI behavior.

**Alternatives Considered**: None - follows constitution requirements.
