# Contributing Guidelines

## GitHub Issues

GitHub issues should be used for bug reports only. Feature requests and refactor requests should be contributed by adding a new file to the `specs/` directory.

## Specs

Specs are stored in the `specs/` directory.

Each spec should be a markdown file with a numeric prefix - for example, `000-mvp.md`.

Each spec file should contain the following:

- Title
- Description
  - A few sentences describing why this change will be useful.
- Design Decisions (optional)
  - A list of design decisions that were made, with pros and cons for the different options considered.
- Task List
  - A checklist of tasks for the implementing the change.
