# Feature Specification: 002-docker-container

**Feature Branch**: `002-docker-container`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "002-docker-container Add Docker support to the time-tracker project for safe testing by the LLM agent without affecting the user's system. Include CI automation to push the latest Docker container on every push to the main branch."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Add Docker support to the time-tracker project to enable the LLM agent to safely test the project without affecting the user's actual install. Include CI automation to push the latest Docker container on every push to the main branch.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project includes Docker support, **When** the LLM agent builds and runs the project in a Docker container, **Then** the user's system remains unaffected by the testing process.
2. **Given** a push occurs to the main branch, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** the latest Docker container is automatically built and pushed to the registry.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Docker is not installed or available on the system?
- How does the system handle failures during Docker container build or run?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Dockerfile that enables building the time-tracker project into a runnable Docker container.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow the time-tracker application to be executed safely within the Docker container without impacting the host system.
- **FR-003**: CI pipeline MUST automatically build and push the latest Docker container upon pushes to the main branch.
