# Feature Specification: combine-start-and-stop

**Feature Branch**: `003-combine-start-and-stop`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Combine the existing start and stop commands into a single command accessible via aliases s, start, or stop. When called as stop, reject any arguments and prompt to use start. When called as start, require arguments or error."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a unified command to manage time tracking sessions, allowing them to start or stop tracking with simple aliases, ensuring consistent behavior based on how the command is invoked.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no active time tracking session, **When** user runs `start "project-name" "task-name"`, **Then** a new tracking session starts for the specified project and task.
2. **Given** an active time tracking session, **When** user runs `stop`, **Then** the current session stops and time is recorded.
3. **Given** an active time tracking session, **When** user runs `stop "any-argument"`, **Then** system errors and prompts user to use `start` instead.
4. **Given** no active session, **When** user runs `start` without arguments, **Then** system errors due to missing required arguments.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user runs `s` with arguments? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior for 's' alias not specified - should it behave like start?]
- What happens when user runs `s` without arguments? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior for 's' alias not specified - should it behave like stop?]
- How does the system distinguish between 'start' and 'stop' invocations when using aliases?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single command accessible via aliases 's', 'start', and 'stop'.
- **FR-002**: When the command is invoked as 'stop', system MUST reject any provided arguments and prompt user to use 'start'.
- **FR-003**: When the command is invoked as 'start', system MUST require project and task arguments or error.
- **FR-004**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: System MUST define behavior for 's' alias - determine action based on presence of arguments or explicit logic?]
