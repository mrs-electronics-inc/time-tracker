# Feature Specification: 002-docker-container

**Feature**: Add Docker support to the time-tracker Go CLI project to enable safe testing by the LLM agent without affecting the user's system. Include CI automation using GitHub Actions to build and push the latest Docker container to GitHub Container Registry on pushes to the main branch.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Add Docker support to the time-tracker project to enable the LLM agent to safely test the project without affecting the user's actual install. Include CI automation to push the latest Docker container on every push to the main branch.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project includes Docker support, **When** the LLM agent builds and runs the project in a Docker container, **Then** the user's system remains unaffected by the testing process.
2. **Given** a push occurs to the main branch, **When** the CI pipeline runs, **Then** the latest Docker container is automatically built and pushed to the registry.

### Edge Cases
- When Docker is not installed, the system has no special handling and will fail naturally.
- On Docker build or run failures, the system notifies the user with troubleshooting steps.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Dockerfile that enables building the time-tracker project into a runnable Docker container.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow the time-tracker application to be executed safely within the Docker container without impacting the host system.
- **FR-003**: CI pipeline MUST automatically build and push the latest Docker container to GitHub Container Registry upon pushes to the main branch.

## Technical Details & Decisions

### Docker Implementation
- **Decision**: Use multi-stage Docker build with Go base image for building and Alpine for runtime to minimize image size (~20MB vs ~500MB single-stage).
- **Rationale**: Go CLIs are statically linked, allowing small runtime images. Multi-stage builds separate build dependencies from runtime.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Single-stage with Ubuntu (larger), scratch base (no shell for debugging).
- **Best Practices**: Official Go images, copy only binary, no ports exposed, set USER for security.

### CI Automation
- **Decision**: GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to main, building and pushing to GitHub Container Registry.
- **Rationale**: Native integration with GitHub, supports container registry, follows project example workflows.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Manual pushes (error-prone).
- **Best Practices**: Use actions/checkout and actions/setup-go, Docker Buildx for multi-platform, login with secrets, tag 'latest'.

### Project Impact
- No new data entities required; infrastructure addition only.
- Follows TDD with integration tests for Docker build/run/commands.
- Includes docker-compose.yml for easy testing.
- Updates README.md and AGENTS.md with Docker instructions.

### Implementation Status
All tasks completed: Dockerfile, CI workflow, docker-compose, tests, documentation updates.
