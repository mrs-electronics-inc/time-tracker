# New Data Format

We need to improve the format of our data files to make it easier to implement future features.

The overall goal is to remove the `end` field and only have a `start` field on each time entry.

We will have `null` for `project and `title` for empty entries between other entries.

## Task List

### Basic Migration Logic
- [x] Add `version` field to the `data.json` files.
- [x] If the `version` field is missing, assume a version of `0`.

### Add Migrations for Version 1
- [ ] Add migration logic for version `0` to `1` when loading data.
- [ ] Version 1 has the following differences from version 0:
	- [ ] No `id` field for the time entries.
	- [ ] Add blank time entries between entries that have a space between the `end` of one entry and the `start` of the next entry.
	- [ ] No `end` field when saving time entries (the end of each entry is the start of the next entry).
