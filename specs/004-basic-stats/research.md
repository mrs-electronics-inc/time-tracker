# Research Findings: Basic Stats Command

## Decisions

### Command Structure
- Decision: Use Cobra command with persistent flags for --daily, --weekly, --projects
- Rationale: Consistent with existing CLI patterns, allows flag combinations
- Alternatives considered: Subcommands instead of flags (rejected for simplicity)

### Time Calculations
- Decision: Use Go time package for date calculations
- Rationale: Standard library, accurate timezone handling
- Alternatives considered: Third-party libraries (rejected to minimize dependencies)

### Data Aggregation
- Decision: Load all time entries, filter by date range, aggregate by day/week/project
- Rationale: Simple, works with existing JSON storage
- Alternatives considered: Database queries (rejected, not needed for JSON)

### Output Formatting
- Decision: Tabular output with YYYY-MM-DD dates and HH:MM durations
- Rationale: Human-readable, matches clarified requirements
- Alternatives considered: JSON output (available via --json flag if needed)

### Error Handling
- Decision: Display "No data available" for empty periods
- Rationale: Clear user feedback, matches clarified behavior
- Alternatives considered: Exit with error (rejected for better UX)

## Implementation Approach
- Add new stats command to cmd/stats.go
- Use existing file_storage for data access
- Calculate periods relative to current time
- Support flag combinations for flexible views
