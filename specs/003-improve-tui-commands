# Improve TUI Shortcuts

The current start/stop shortcut in the TUI is confusing. It does different things based on the context. We should improve the TUI shortcuts.

## Shortcuts

`r` - resume (replaces start)
    - Duplicate selected project and task into new task
    - Keep using the start entry form so the user can select the start time
`s` - stop
    - Keep as-is
`n` - new
    - Open start entry form with empty project and task
`e` - edit
    - Go to form and allow user to 
`d` - delete
    - Replace project and title with blank entry
