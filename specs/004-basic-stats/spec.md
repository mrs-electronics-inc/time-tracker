# Feature Specification: Basic stats

**Feature Branch**: `004-basic-stats`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement a basic stats command."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a time tracker user, I want to view basic statistics about my tracked time so that I can understand my productivity patterns and project contributions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has tracked time entries in the past week, **When** they run the stats command, **Then** the system displays daily totals for the past 7 days.
2. **Given** the user has tracked time entries in the past month, **When** they run the stats command, **Then** the system displays weekly totals for the past 4 weeks.
3. **Given** the user has tracked time across multiple projects, **When** they run the stats command, **Then** the system displays totals by project for the past week.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no time entries in the specified period?
- How does the system handle partial weeks or months with incomplete data?
- What if the user has no projects or tasks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display daily time totals for the past 7 days [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what format for dates and times?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST display weekly time totals for the past 4 weeks
- **FR-003**: System MUST display time totals grouped by project for the past week
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle cases where no data exists for the requested periods [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what message or behavior when no data?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate totals based on tracked time entries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Time Entry**: Represents a period of tracked time with duration, project, and task
- **Project**: Represents a grouping of tasks with associated time entries
