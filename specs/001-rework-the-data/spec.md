# Feature Specification: Rework the data model

**Feature Branch**: `001-rework-the-data`  
**Created**: Wed Sep 24 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Rework the data model for the project. We should store time entries rather than tasks. Each time entry will have a start timestamp, end timestamp (null while it is running), project, and title."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: What should happen when a user tries to stop a time entry that is already stopped? ‚Üí A: Do nothing and confirm it's already stopped.
- Q: How should the system handle attempts to start a new time entry when one is already active? ‚Üí A: Automatically stop the current active entry and start the new one.
- Q: What should happen if a start timestamp is set in the future? ‚Üí A: timestamp is set by program, not by user
- Q: How are time entries uniquely identified? ‚Üí A: by autogenerated numeric ID

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a time tracker user, I want the system to store my time entries as time entries with start and end timestamps, project, and title, instead of as tasks, so that I can have more granular and flexible time tracking.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user starts a new time entry, **When** they provide project and title, **Then** a time entry is created with start timestamp set to current time and end timestamp as null.
2. **Given** a running time entry with end timestamp null, **When** the user stops the entry, **Then** the end timestamp is set to current time.
3. **Given** a completed time entry, **When** the user views it, **Then** both start and end timestamps are displayed along with project and title.

### Edge Cases

- When a user tries to stop a entry that is already stopped, do nothing and confirm it's already stopped.
- When starting a new time entry while one is active, automatically stop the current active entry and start the new one.
- Start timestamps are always set to current time by the program, preventing future timestamps.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST store time entries as time entries instead of tasks.
- **FR-002**: Each time entry MUST include a start timestamp, end timestamp (nullable), project, and title.
- **FR-003**: End timestamp MUST be null while the time entry is actively running.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow creation of new time entries with start timestamp set to current time.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow updating a running time entry to set the end timestamp to current time.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Time Entry**: Represents a period of tracked time, with attributes: id (numeric, unique), start timestamp, end timestamp (nullable if running), project name, and title.
