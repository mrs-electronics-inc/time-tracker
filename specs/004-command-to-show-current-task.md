# Command to View the Current Task

It would be great to have a subcommand, available directly from command-line without the TUI, that outputs the currently running task.

The command could be `current`, aliases `curr` and `c`.

# Task List

- [ ] Create convenience function to return current running task
- [ ] Output something like:

    ```text
    mrs-sdk-qt review #46, duration 18m
    ```

- [ ] Show nothing if no task is running
